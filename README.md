# PLC-Unity

## Overview
This project is a Unity project to draw a group of point cloud data in the virtual world. This project is not designed as a stand-alone module to do the point cloud drawing by file reading. This project is part of ARENA to receive the data stream of point cloud from a server and to draw received point cloud in real time.

## Thrid-Part Texture
The texture used to draw one point is from [Pcx](https://github.com/keijiro/Pcx) project. In this project, we have already imported the Unity package released by Pcx project. If you want to create a project from scratch while using the same point texture, please install the [Unity package](https://github.com/keijiro/Pcx/releases) in the new project.
